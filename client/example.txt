I apologize for the confusion. The issue you're facing seems to be related to the specific Prolog system you're using, and it might not support the initialization/2 directive in the way SWI-Prolog does.

To work around this issue, you can move the test_type_checking predicate call outside of the initialization/2 directive and run it directly in your Prolog interpreter. For example:

Comment out the :- initialization(test_type_checking, main). line.

Save your Prolog program without that line.

Open your Prolog interpreter (SWI-Prolog or another) and consult the saved Prolog program.

After consulting the program, manually call test_type_checking. in the interpreter.

This should execute your tests without encountering the "procedure `(A:-B)' does not exist" error.
