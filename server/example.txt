Unhandled Exception: This error often occurs when an exception is thrown in your C++ code, but there is no associated try-catch block to catch the exception and handle it. As a result, the program terminates unexpectedly.

To resolve this, make sure to use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may be thrown within your code.

Out-of-Memory: In some cases, this error can occur when your program runs out of memory (e.g., due to excessive memory allocation) and the new operator is unable to allocate memory.

To address this, ensure that you are properly managing memory in your program and that you release memory when it's no longer needed. Also, consider optimizing memory usage.

Incompatibility or Library Issue: Sometimes, this error can be related to compatibility issues between libraries or an issue with the C++ runtime. It can be caused by using incompatible versions of libraries or making certain calls that the system cannot handle.

To resolve this, ensure that you are using compatible libraries and that you are using the correct functions or API calls.
